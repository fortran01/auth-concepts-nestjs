# Test Coverage

When implementing new features or updating existing ones:

1. Unit/Integration Tests:
   - Write unit tests for each new function/method
   - Update existing unit tests for modified functions
   - Test both success and failure scenarios
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Aim for >80% code coverage
   - Place in appropriate `/test` directory matching source structure

2. End-to-End Tests:
   - Write E2E tests for new API endpoints/flows
   - Update existing E2E tests for modified endpoints
   - Test complete user journeys
   - Include authentication flows if applicable
   - Test error handling and edge cases
