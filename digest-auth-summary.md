# Digest Authentication Implementation for NestJS

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Digest Authentication with nonce-based challenge-response in NestJS.

## Files Implemented

1. **NonceService** (`src/auth/nonce/nonce.service.ts`)
   - Manages nonce generation and verification
   - Implements nonce cleanup to prevent memory leaks
   - Tracks valid nonces to prevent replay attacks

2. **NonceModule** (`src/auth/nonce/nonce.module.ts`)
   - Provides and exports the NonceService

3. **DigestAuthGuard** (`src/auth/guards/digest-auth.guard.ts`)
   - Implements Digest Authentication as a NestJS guard
   - Verifies the digest response
   - Manages challenge-response flow

4. **DigestAuthMiddleware** (`src/middleware/digest-auth.middleware.ts`)
   - Alternative implementation as middleware
   - Same core functionality as the guard

5. **Digest Auth Endpoint** (`src/auth/auth.controller.ts`)
   - Route handler for `/auth/digest`
   - Protected with the DigestAuthGuard

6. **Digest Auth Template** (`src/views/digest-auth.hbs`)
   - Display page for successful authentication
   - Educational content about how Digest Auth works

7. **Test Script** (`src/scripts/test-digest-auth.js`)
   - Manual testing tool for Digest Authentication
   - Demonstrates the challenge-response flow

8. **E2E Test** (`test/auth/digest-auth.e2e-spec.ts`)
   - Basic test for authentication challenge

## How Digest Authentication Works

1. **The Challenge**
   - When a client requests a protected resource, the server responds with a 401 status code
   - Server includes a `WWW-Authenticate` header with a nonce value, realm, and other parameters
   - This nonce is stored server-side for verification

2. **The Response**
   - The client calculates three hash values:
     - HA1 = MD5(username:realm:password)
     - HA2 = MD5(method:uri)
     - Response = MD5(HA1:nonce:HA2)
   - Client sends this response in an `Authorization` header along with username, realm, nonce, etc.

3. **The Verification**
   - Server validates that the nonce is valid and hasn't been used before
   - Server verifies the user exists
   - Server repeats the same hash calculations
   - If the calculated response matches the client's response, access is granted
   - Otherwise, a new challenge is issued

## Advantages and Security Considerations

### Advantages
- Passwords are not transmitted in plaintext over the network
- Replay attacks are prevented by the use of nonces
- More secure than Basic Authentication
- Widely supported by browsers and HTTP clients

### Security Considerations
- The server still needs to know the user's password (or equivalent) for verification
- Not as secure as modern token-based authentication methods like JWT or OAuth 2.0
- Should be used over HTTPS for maximum security

## Testing

Manual testing can be performed using:

```bash
# Use curl with the --digest flag to handle the challenge-response
curl -v --digest -u admin:secret http://localhost:3000/auth/digest

# Or run the testing script
npm run test:digest
```

## Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates how to properly implement Digest Authentication in a NestJS application, following the HTTP Authentication framework guidelines (RFC 7616). The code is modular, maintainable, and includes proper error handling.
